# Backlog — auth-reset
Task states: TODO | DOING | DONE | BLOCKED.

## Bugs
(human-reported bugs land here, newest at top; they outrank everything)
- BUG [P1]: Invite/reset email uses the workers.dev address, not the site's custom domain. — repro: site with a custom domain attached → invite a user → email body link is `https://bizbeecms-cms-<slug>.<acct>.workers.dev/invite/accept/<token>` instead of the custom domain. Subject is also generic ("You're invited to BizbeeCMS"). — reported 2026-06-26.
  STATUS 2026-06-26: PART (2) CMS subject DONE; PART (2) PM subject DONE (this run —
  PM invite AND reset email subjects now domain-prefixed via `inviteSubject`). PART (1)
  link host is the shared APP_ORIGIN deployer fix tracked in `sso`/`cms-mcp` — NOT
  fixed here by design. ONLY loose end: verify domain-prefixed subject + correct link
  host in the live HITL round-trip AFTER the deployer APP_ORIGIN fix lands + redeploy.
  Once verified live, flip this bug to DONE.
  TWO PARTS:
  (1) **Link host** = the SHARED `APP_ORIGIN`-ignores-custom-domains defect already tracked in `sso` and `cms-mcp` (deployer `src/index.ts` ~520 always sets `APP_ORIGIN` to workers.dev even when a custom domain is attached). `lib/mail/send-invite.ts` builds the accept URL from `APP_ORIGIN`, so it inherits workers.dev. DO NOT fix APP_ORIGIN a fourth time — the ONE deployer fix (set APP_ORIGIN = primary custom domain when attached, www-canonical) serves invite + reset + Google redirect_uri + /mcp URL together. After that lands + redeploy, the invite/reset link is correct with no change here. Track it; verify the link host as part of the live HITL round-trip.
  (2) **Subject line** (invite-specific, lives ONLY here): when the site has a custom domain, the invite subject must be `<domain>: You are invited to use BizBeeCMS` (e.g. `restovista.com: You are invited to use BizBeeCMS`); generic subject otherwise. The domain is the same primary custom-domain value APP_ORIGIN resolves to — derive the subject from APP_ORIGIN's host (strip scheme/`www.`?) so it stays consistent with the link. Applies to BOTH apps' invite mail and, by mirror, the reset mail subject if it should carry the domain too (confirm in CAVEATS). EN/FI/ET — the subject is a localized string with a `{domain}` placeholder; the generic (no-custom-domain) subject keeps the current wording. Gate: app tsc + node test the subject-builder (custom-domain → prefixed; no-domain → generic) + opennext build; CMS work regens PM `cms-bundle` last.

## Tasks
PM first (slices P1–P5), then mirror in CMS (slices C1–C5). ONE app per worker run.

USER 2026-06-23: the reset ROUTE tests (PM+CMS forgot/reset) are tautological
source-text asserts (`readFileSync` + `assert.match` regex on the route/lib
source) — they verify code EXISTS, not that it WORKS. Replace them with real
behavioral tests over a fake-D1 harness. NOTE: a proven harness already exists,
trapped inside `ProjectManager/src/lib/deploy/deploy-events.test.ts` (`fakeD1()`
drives the REAL drizzle-D1 client over an in-memory fake D1 — records prepared
SQL + bound params, can seed rows for reads). Promote it to a shared test util,
then convert the reset route tests to drive the real `createPasswordReset` /
`checkReset` / `applyReset` over it. The pure `reset-logic.test.ts` files are
already genuine — leave them.

- DONE: **TEST-HARNESS-PM — shared fake-D1 test util + PM reset route tests now
  behavioral.** Extracted `fakeD1()`/`fakeD1Rows()` (+ added `fakeD1Returning()`
  for multi-statement flows) into shared `ProjectManager/src/lib/test/fake-d1.ts`;
  `deploy-events.test.ts` imports it (its tests stay green). Refactored `reset.ts`
  to the deploy-events INJECTED-DB SEAM: `@/` imports → relative
  (`../../db/schema.ts`, `../auth/password.ts`), `getDb`/`session` pulled in
  LAZILY via dynamic import only when no dep is injected, and
  `createPasswordReset`/`checkReset`/`applyReset` take an optional injected
  `Db`/session-invalidator (defaults = real). Now `reset.ts` LOADS under
  `node --test` and the tests DRIVE the real fns over the real drizzle-D1 client
  on a fake D1: `createPasswordReset` writes a 64-hex token + 7d-TTL row;
  `applyReset` marks usedAt under the isNull guard, writes a fresh `pbkdf2$…`
  hash, kills the right userId's sessions; single-use (guarded update → 0 rows ⇒
  rejected, no rehash); expired/used/notFound all collapse to non-ok before any
  write. DELETED the source-grep asserts; KEPT the structural enumeration-safe
  route lock (single `{ok:true}` after the user block — runtime deep-equal would
  be tautological) + i18n bodies (executed on real data). Fail-before verified
  (drop the `marked.length===0` guard ⇒ single-use test fails; reverted). Gates
  green: tsc 0 / 173 node tests / opennext build. PM only; no bundle:cms.

- DONE: **TEST-HARNESS-CMS — CMS reset route tests now behavioral (mirror PM).**
  Ported the shared util to `CMS/src/lib/test/fake-d1.ts`; refactored
  `CMS/src/lib/reset/reset.ts` to the injected-Db seam (relative `../../db/schema.ts`,
  `Db` type from RELATIVE `../ports/db.ts`, lazy `(await import("../ports/db.ts"))
  .getDb()`, optional injected `Db` defaulting real) so it LOADS under node --test;
  rewrote `forgot-route.test.ts` + `reset-route.test.ts` to drive the real
  createPasswordReset/checkReset/applyReset over the fake D1 — 64-hex+7d-TTL insert
  into SINGULAR `password_reset`; guarded isNull single-use; fresh `pbkdf2$` hash on
  `user`; CMS session kill asserted as INDEXED `delete from "session" where
  "user_id"=?` for the right userId. DELETED source-grep asserts; KEPT enumeration-safe
  structural lock + i18n bodies. Fail-before verified. Gates GREEN (tsc 0 / 760 node
  tests / opennext build). **`bundle:cms` DEFERRED** — other workers had uncommitted
  in-flight CMS/PM changes; regen would bake their unfinished work into the committed
  bundle. My change is test-only + a backward-compatible reset.ts seam (no runtime
  behavior change), so the bundle needs no regen for correctness — a later worker
  regenerates cleanly.


- DONE: **P1 — PM `password_resets` table + migration.** Added `passwordResets`
  to schema (`id`, `userId` FK→users cascade, `token` unique, `expiresAt`,
  `usedAt` nullable, `createdAt`) + types. Migration `0011_simple_rhino.sql`.
  Gates green (tsc / 154 tests / opennext build).

- DONE: **P2 — PM `POST /api/auth/forgot`.** REST route looks up user by email;
  if found, mints a `password_resets` row (`lib/reset/reset.ts`, 64-hex token,
  7d TTL via `RESET_TTL_MS`) and sends the reset email via new `sendResetEmail`
  in `lib/mail/send-invite.ts` (extracted a shared `buildUrl`; reset link is
  `/reset/<token>` from `APP_ORIGIN`, graceful degrade). ALWAYS returns 200
  `{ ok: true }` for hit AND miss; mint/send wrapped in try/catch so failures
  never leak existence. Strings `auth.forgot.email.{subject,body}` added EN/FI/ET.
  Test `lib/reset/forgot-route.test.ts`. Gates green (tsc / 158 tests / opennext).

- DONE: **P3 — PM `POST /api/auth/reset`.** Added `checkReset`/`applyReset` to
  `lib/reset/reset.ts` (mirror invite's `checkInvite`): classify notFound/used/
  expired/valid; `applyReset` marks `usedAt` under an `isNull(usedAt)` guarded
  update (single-use, concurrency-safe), sets a fresh `hashPassword` on the user,
  then `invalidateUserSessions(userId)`. New `invalidateUserSessions` in
  `lib/auth/session.ts` (KV `list({prefix})` scan → delete records matching
  userId; ponytail: O(all sessions), add a userId→session index if volume grows).
  Route `src/app/api/auth/reset/route.ts`: validates token presence + password
  (register min-length via `validatePassword`) + confirm match; ALL invalid/
  expired/used collapse to one generic `auth.errors.resetTokenInvalid` (no detail
  leak). String added EN/FI/ET. Test `lib/reset/reset-route.test.ts`. Gates green
  (tsc / 166 tests / opennext build; route in manifest).

- DONE: **P4 — PM forgot/reset pages + login link.** `(auth)/forgot` page+form
  (email → POST /api/auth/forgot; on any 2xx shows the enumeration-safe success +
  back-to-sign-in, no body branching) + `(auth)/reset/[token]` page+form
  (password+confirm → POST /api/auth/reset, min-length 10 via MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH,
  generic resetTokenInvalid for all token failures, success → /login). Added a
  "Forgot password?" link to `login-form.tsx`. New strings auth.login.forgotPassword
  + auth.forgot.{title,subtitle,submit,success,backToSignIn} + auth.reset.{title,
  subtitle,submit} in EN/FI/ET. Gates green (tsc / 166 tests / opennext build;
  both pages in .next/server output).

- DONE: **P5 — PM reset pure-logic tests.** Extracted token classification out of
  `checkReset` into a pure `lib/reset/reset-logic.ts` (`classifyReset(row, now)`,
  no DB/`@/` deps) so it's BEHAVIORALLY testable; `checkReset` now delegates to it.
  New `reset-logic.test.ts` EXECUTES the real logic: validity, expiry BOUNDARY
  (just-valid @ now+1, expired @ now and now-1 — `<=` not `<`), single-use
  (`usedAt` set ⇒ used; used wins over expired), notFound, default-now.
  Fail-before verified (flip `<=`→`<` ⇒ boundary test fails). Rewired the
  source-text check in `reset-route.test.ts` to assert the delegation.
  Enumeration-safe hit===miss is already structurally locked by
  `forgot-route.test.ts` (single `{ok:true}` after the user block) — NOT
  re-added as a tautological deep-equal of a literal. Gates green
  (tsc / 170 tests / opennext build). **PM half P1–P5 COMPLETE.**

- DONE: **C1 — CMS `password_reset` table + migration.** Added `passwordReset`
  to `CMS/src/db/schema.ts` (`id`, `userId` FK→`user.id` ON DELETE cascade,
  `token` unique, `expiresAt`, `usedAt` nullable, `createdAt`) +
  `PasswordReset`/`NewPasswordReset` types. Table is SINGULAR `password_reset`
  (CMS naming convention: `user`/`session`/`invite`, not PM's plurals). FK kept
  per the C1 task spec (CMS's session/invite drop FKs by convention, but the
  spec asked for a cascade FK — done). Migration `0012_supreme_shriek.sql`
  (drizzle-kit generate auto-updated meta journal+snapshot). No route this run.
  Gates green (tsc / 733 tests / opennext build). NO bundle:cms (that's C5).
- DONE: **C2 — CMS `POST /api/auth/forgot`.** REST route (`CMS/src/app/api/auth/
  forgot/route.ts`) looks up user by email via CMS `findUserByEmail`; if found,
  mints a `password_reset` row (new `CMS/src/lib/reset/reset.ts`: `newResetToken`
  64-hex, `RESET_TTL_MS` 7d, `createPasswordReset` → `schema.passwordReset`
  SINGULAR) and sends the reset email via new `sendResetEmail` in CMS
  `lib/mail/send-invite.ts` (extracted shared `buildUrl`; `/reset/<token>` from
  `APP_ORIGIN`, graceful degrade). ALWAYS returns 200 `{ ok: true }` for hit AND
  miss; malformed email → 400 (inline regex, CMS has no `validateEmail`);
  mint/send in try/catch so failures never leak existence. New top-level
  `resetEmail.{subject,body}` strings EN/FI/ET (mirrors `inviteEmail`). Test
  `lib/reset/forgot-route.test.ts`. Gates green (tsc / 737 tests / opennext build;
  route in manifest). NO bundle:cms (that's C5).
- DONE: **C3 — CMS `POST /api/auth/reset`.** Added `checkReset`/`applyReset` to
  `CMS/src/lib/reset/reset.ts` + pure `reset-logic.ts` (`classifyReset`, alias-free).
  `applyReset` re-validates via `checkReset`→`classifyReset`, marks `usedAt` under a
  guarded `update … where isNull(usedAt) … returning` (0 rows ⇒ used ⇒ reject) BEFORE
  hashing (TOCTOU-safe), sets a fresh `hashPassword` on `schema.user`, then kills the
  user's sessions with a PLAIN INDEXED `delete from session where userId = ?` (CMS
  sessions are D1 w/ `session_user_idx` — no KV prefix-scan like PM). Route
  `CMS/src/app/api/auth/reset/route.ts` returns web `Response.json`; min-length via
  `isPasswordLongEnough` (MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH=10, same as invite-accept); ALL
  invalid/expired/used collapse to ONE generic `resetTokenInvalid` (never reads
  `reason`). Error keys are bare (`passwordRequired`/`passwordTooShort`/
  `passwordMismatch`/`resetTokenInvalid`) — translated by the C4 page, mirroring how
  invite-accept route works, so C3 adds NO message strings (i18n parity untouched).
  Test `lib/reset/reset-route.test.ts` (source-text, +6). Gates green (tsc / 743 tests
  / opennext build; route in manifest). NO bundle:cms (that's C5).
- DONE: **C4 — CMS forgot/reset pages + login-form link.** Public `/forgot` page
  (`app/forgot/page.tsx` → `ForgotPasswordForm`: email → POST /api/auth/forgot;
  on ANY 2xx shows the enumeration-safe success + back-to-sign-in, NO body
  branching) + `/reset/[token]` page (`app/reset/[token]/page.tsx` server-gates on
  `checkReset` status like invite-accept — notFound/expired/used all collapse to
  ONE generic notice; valid → `ResetPasswordForm`: password+confirm → POST
  /api/auth/reset, minLength 10, maps bare error keys
  resetTokenInvalid/passwordTooShort/passwordRequired/passwordMismatch to messages,
  success → hard-nav /admin which shows login since sessions were killed). Added a
  "Forgot password?" link (`href="/forgot"`) under the login button in
  `login-form.tsx`. REST+fetch, NO server actions. New strings: top-level
  `forgotPassword.*` + `resetPassword.*` + `login.forgotPassword` (CMS top-level
  convention, NOT PM's `auth.*` nesting) in EN/FI/ET (parity verified 0 missing/
  extra). Gates green (tsc / 743 tests / opennext build; both pages in route
  table). NO bundle:cms (that's C5). UI-only slice — no new behavioral test (pages
  are thin wiring over the already-tested forgot/reset routes).
- DONE: **C5 — CMS reset pure-logic tests + regen PM `cms-bundle`.** New
  `CMS/src/lib/reset/reset-logic.test.ts` EXECUTES the real `classifyReset`
  (mirrors PM's): validity, expiry BOUNDARY (just-valid @ now+1, expired @ now
  and now-1, `<=` not `<`), single-use (`usedAt` ⇒ used; used wins over expired),
  notFound, default-now. Fail-before verified (flip `<=`→`<` ⇒ boundary test
  fails, reverted). Then ran `bundle:cms` (from PM) as LAST step → regenerated
  `ProjectManager/src/lib/deploy/cms-bundle.generated.js` (7853 KB) shipping all
  CMS C1–C5 changes into the PM-deployable bundle. Gates green: CMS tsc / 748
  tests / opennext build; PM tsc + opennext build confirmed after bundle regen.
  **CMS half C1–C5 COMPLETE → auth-reset full PM+CMS scope done.**

Build order rationale: schema→API(forgot)→API(reset)→UI→tests per app. PM proves
the shape; CMS mirrors it. The forgot endpoint can land before reset (it just
mints+emails); reset needs the table from slice 1. Tests last so they assert the
real shipped behavior.
