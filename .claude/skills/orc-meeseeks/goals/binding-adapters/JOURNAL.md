# Journal — binding-adapters
Every completed (or blocked) task, newest at the bottom. Never redo anything marked DONE here.

## 2026-06-18 18:41 — Storage port + CfStorage adapter
- **Status:** DONE
- **What I did:** Created `CMS/src/lib/ports/storage.ts` — the `Storage` interface
  (only the 3 R2 methods asset-store uses: `put`/`get`/`delete`), a `CfStorage`
  adapter wrapping an `R2Bucket` (translates `{contentType}` → R2 `httpMetadata`
  exactly as before), and `getStorage()` — now the SOLE reader of `env.MEDIA`.
  Routed `asset-store.ts` through `getStorage()`; deleted its local `getBucket()`
  and the `getCloudflareContext` import (moved into the port). Zero behavior change.
- **Verified:** New `scripts/storage-port.test.mjs` (4 tests) drives the REAL
  imported `CfStorage` against an in-memory fake R2 bucket, asserting what R2
  actually receives (httpMetadata translation + get/delete pass-through) — not
  tautological "was-called". Full suite green (223 tests). Deploy gate
  `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build` succeeded.

## 2026-06-18 18:48 — Ai port + CfAi adapter
- **Status:** DONE
- **What I did:** Created `CMS/src/lib/ports/ai.ts` — the `Ai` port. The chat
  route was the only real `env.AI` reader (the `lib/chat/*` mentions are just doc
  comments). Port = one method `chat(messages, {model, tools?, gatewayId?})` →
  `ReadableStream`; `CfAi` wraps `ai.run(model, {messages, stream:true, tools},
  {gateway:{id}})` 1:1 — streaming + OpenAI message/tool shape + AI Gateway all
  preserved. `getAi()` is the SOLE `env.AI` reader (returns null when unbound, so
  the route still answers 503 not 500); `getGatewayId()` is the sole `AI_GATEWAY`
  reader (moved the in-route `gatewayId()` helper into the port). Route now calls
  `await ai.chat(...)`, dropping the `getCloudflareContext` import + the
  `Parameters<Ai["run"]>` casts. Extract only, zero behavior change.
- **Verified:** New `scripts/ai-port.test.mjs` (2 tests) drives the REAL imported
  `CfAi` against a fake `env.AI` binding, asserting the real call shape (model +
  `{messages, stream:true, tools}` + `{gateway:{id}}`) AND that the upstream
  stream is returned as-is (sentinel identity check — NOT buffered), plus that
  tools/gateway are omitted when absent. Full suite 227 green (was 225). Deploy
  gate `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build` succeeded.

  `CMS/scripts/ai-port.test.mjs` (new)

## 2026-06-18 — Db port + cfDb adapter
- **Status:** DONE
- **What I did:** Created `CMS/src/lib/ports/db.ts` — the `Db` port. Drizzle is
  already the layer, so the port is thin: `Db` = the drizzle-D1 client type,
  `cfDb(d1)` = the exact `drizzle(env.DB, {schema})` construction, and `getDb()`
  is now the SOLE reader of `env.DB`. Re-homed `src/db/index.ts` to a 2-line
  re-export from the port, so all ~6 `@/db` caller modules (page/component/
  settings/translate-store, `[[...slug]]/page.tsx`) are UNCHANGED. Extract only,
  zero behavior change.
- **Verified:** New `scripts/db-port.test.mjs` (2 tests) drives the REAL imported
  `cfDb` against an in-memory fake D1 that records prepared SQL+params, asserting
  the real schema → real SQLite SQL wiring (hits `"page"` table, parameterised
  where, real columns on insert) — not "was drizzle called". Full suite 225 green
  (was 223). Deploy gate `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build` succeeded.
- **Files:** `CMS/src/lib/ports/db.ts` (new), `CMS/src/db/index.ts` (now re-export),
  `CMS/scripts/db-port.test.mjs` (new)

## 2026-06-18 18:52 — Unified adapter factory (env → {db,storage,ai})
- **Status:** DONE
- **What I did:** Created `CMS/src/lib/ports/index.ts` — `getPorts()`, the single
  place that reads the Cloudflare context ONCE and hands back all three ports as
  `{ db, storage, ai }`. Thin: it composes the existing `cfDb`/`CfStorage`/`CfAi`
  adapter classes over one resolved `env` (no second env read, no re-implementing
  the per-binding factories). Split into a binding-shaped `cfPorts(env)` seam
  (testable) + the `getPorts()` context wrapper. Preserved EVERY contract: `db` =
  exact `cfDb(env.DB)` drizzle; `storage` = `CfStorage(env.MEDIA)`, throws if MEDIA
  unbound (matches `getStorage()`); `ai` = `CfAi(env.AI)` OR `null` when AI is
  absent (getAi nullability preserved). The individual `getDb/getStorage/getAi`
  are untouched for single-binding callers. Extract/compose only — zero behavior
  change; no caller rewired (no module currently needs all three at once).
- **Verified:** New `scripts/ports-factory.test.mjs` (4 tests) drives the REAL
  imported `cfPorts` against fake bindings: composes the real CfStorage
  (contentType->httpMetadata), real drizzle `db` (a `db.query.page.findFirst()`
  prepares SQL hitting the `page` table on the fake D1), real CfAi (streaming
  inputs reach the binding), `ai === null` when AI unbound, and throws when MEDIA
  unbound. Full suite 231 green (was 227). Deploy gate `npx opennextjs-cloudflare
  build` succeeded.

## 2026-06-18 18:58 — CMS module against a mocked Db port (the seam's payoff)
- **Status:** DONE
- **What I did:** Proved the ports seam earns its keep with a real-business-logic
  unit test of `upsertPage` (`CMS/src/db/page-store.ts`). Added a tiny
  zero-behavior-change injection seam: `upsertPage(page, injectedDb?: Db)` —
  prod path unchanged (`injectedDb ?? await getDb()`), tests pass a fake. New
  `scripts/page-store.test.mjs` (5 tests) builds a `Db` via the REAL `cfDb`
  adapter over an in-memory `node:sqlite` fake D1 (a thin `prepare/bind/run/all/
  raw` shim) with the REAL migration `page` DDL — so queries compile to real SQL,
  hit a real table, rows really persist. Honest assertions on RETURNED data +
  persisted rows: (1) create persists the row with JSON-serialized blocks/meta,
  (2) update-in-place on (parent,slug) — no duplicate, same id, status changed,
  (3) parentSlug→parentPageId resolution for a child, (4) missing-parent
  rejection (`errors:['parent page "ghost" not found']`, nothing written),
  (5) same slug coexists under two different parents (the unique key is
  (parent,slug)). No tautological "was-called" / `toHaveBeenCalledWith`.
- **To make page-store node-loadable** I switched its runtime VALUE imports off
  the `@/` alias to relative `.ts` (`../lib/ports/db.ts`, `../lib/render/tree.ts`)
  — the project convention for any module a node --test imports (see other test
  headers: "no @/ alias"). Type-only `@/` imports stay (erased by strip-only).
  Same `getDb`/`schema` source `db/index.ts` re-exports — zero behavior change.
- **Verified:** `node --test scripts/page-store.test.mjs` 5/5 green. Full suite
  236 green (was 231). Deploy gate `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build` succeeded.
- **Files:** `CMS/src/db/page-store.ts` (+`injectedDb` param, relative value
  imports), `CMS/scripts/page-store.test.mjs` (new)

## 2026-06-18 19:03 — Mocked-Db unit test of settings-store (content-locales)
- **Status:** DONE
- **What I did:** Added a second mocked-port store test, `scripts/settings-store.test.mjs` (5),
  driving the REAL `getContentLocales`/`setContentLocales` via a new `injectedDb?: Db` seam against
  the REAL `cfDb` over an in-memory `node:sqlite` fake D1 (real `site_settings` table). Honest
  assertions on persisted rows + returned config: safe-default-when-unset (no write on read),
  normalize→persist→read round-trip, key-keyed upsert (update-in-place, no dup row), AND the two
  defensive read branches page-store lacks — present-but-garbage JSON and valid-JSON-wrong-shape both
  fall back to `defaultContentLocales()` without throwing. Expected shapes come from the REAL
  `normalizeContentLocales`/`defaultContentLocales` (not hardcoded), so a regression in store OR
  normalizer is caught. Threaded `injectedDb` through `upsertSetting` + the content-locale accessors;
  switched settings-store's runtime VALUE `@/` imports to relative `.ts` (db port + localize/theme/
  site-settings) so node --test can load it — zero behavior change (prod path = `injectedDb ?? await getDb()`).
- **Verified:** `npm test` 241 green (was 236, +5); `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build` green (deploy gate).
  Confirmed no env.DB/MEDIA/AI read exists OUTSIDE the port factories — the sole-reader invariant still
  holds (admin/layout + auth/guard read CONFIG vars PM_ORIGIN/CMS_AUTH_SECRET/SITE_ID, not the bindings,
  so out of this goal's scope).
- **Files:** CMS/scripts/settings-store.test.mjs (new), CMS/src/db/settings-store.ts (injectedDb seam + relative imports)

## 2026-06-18 19:06 — GREP-GUARD freezing the sole-reader invariant
- **Status:** DONE
- **What I did:** Added `CMS/scripts/ports-sole-reader.guard.test.mjs` — a structural
  guard that scans `CMS/src` and FAILS if any real `env.DB`/`env.MEDIA`/`env.AI`
  BINDING read appears OUTSIDE the allowlisted port dir (`CMS/src/lib/ports/`). Protects
  the whole seam the prior 6 workers built: future code that bypasses the ports breaks CI.
  Three tests: (1) the guard (no violations outside ports), (2) a non-vacuous check (the
  ports dir DOES contain >=1 real read, so green means "none outside", not "matcher
  broken"), (3) a direct unit of the comment-stripper + matcher. Key design: a lexer-lite
  `stripComments` removes `//` and block comments (the chat route's JSDoc mentions `env.AI`
  all over — those must NOT trip the guard), and the matcher is `\benv\.(DB|MEDIA|AI)\b`
  with a trailing word boundary so config vars `env.AI_GATEWAY`/`PM_ORIGIN`/`SITE_ID` are
  deliberately excluded (per CAVEATS: bindings ≠ config vars). Test-only, no app code touched.
- **Verified:** PASSES NOW (invariant holds per #6). PROVED it fails on a stray read:
  injected `const __stray = env.DB;` into `src/db/asset-store.ts` → guard went red naming
  `db/asset-store.ts:59` exactly; reverted → green (`src/` clean via git status). Full suite
  244 green (was 241, +3). Deploy gate `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build` succeeded (dev off first).
